# Study details
Improving student perception and confidence using programming in manufacturing engineering
## Who is conducting the study?
- Dr. Casey Keulen, Assistant Professor of Teaching, Materials Engineering  casey.keulen@ubc.ca (Principal Investigator)
- Meet Upadhyay, Ph.D. Candidate, Materials Engineering                      meet.upadhyay@ubc.ca (Co-Investigator)
## Who will be analysing the data? 
Data will be analyzed by Meet Upadhyay, Ph.D. candidate in Materials Engineering.
## Why are we doing this study?
 The purpose of this study is to improve programming skills confidence. Your responses will be used to develop and improve Jupyter book resources for MANU 230. Anonymized data from this study may be presented at scholarly conferences. Aggregate data and/or anonymized quotes may also be shared publicly.
## What will happen in this study?
 You will be asked to complete two 10-minute surveys, one at the beginning of the term and one at the end of the term. Your participation in the survey is voluntary and will not impact your grade; your instructor will not see the data until final grades have been submitted and you may stop responding to the survey at any time. You will be given a unique code to use for the surveys to link your survey responses across the term. Only you and the co-investigator will have access to this code. The instructor will not have access to this code, and you will not be linked to your responses. You can withdraw from this study at any time. If you choose to withdraw before the end of the term, we will use your code to locate your responses, and they will be destroyed. If we have begun reporting results, we will not be able to remove your responses.
## Are there any risks in taking part in this study?
 Participating in this study could in no way be harmful to you.
## What are the benefits to you participating in this study?
 The result may impact you by helping you reflect upon your skills with programming and identify challenges to learning. Your responses will contribute to resources for advancing teaching and learning practices at UBC and beyond.
## Confidentiality
 Data will be securely stored on encrypted computers and shared between the researchers using a FIPPA and PIPEDA compliant (federal government mandated) tool.  The Principal Investigator will only have access to the anonymized data. The information gathered from the surveys will be stored for 5 years at UBC on a secure and encrypted data storage system.
## Who can you contact if you have questions about the study?
 If you have any questions about the study and your data, please contact Meet Upadhyay, meet.upadhyay@ubc.ca 
## Who can you contact if you have complaints or concerns about the study?
 If you have any concerns or complaints about your rights as a research participant and/or your experiences while participating in this study, contact the Research Participant Complaint Line in the UBC Office of Research Ethics at 604-822-8598 or if long distance e-mail RSIL@ors.ubc.ca or call toll free 1-877-822-8598.
## Consent
 Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and you may refuse to participate or withdraw from it at any time. Your responses will be anonymized using your unique code and will not be linked to your identity. The responses may also be used in presentations and publications and be made available to research journals. By completing this survey, you consent to participate in this study and having your responses included in the analyses.
