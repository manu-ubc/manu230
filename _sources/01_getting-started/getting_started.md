# Getting Started: Introduction to Jupyter and Python!

Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook! In this notebook, we will explore the basics of Python programming through examples and applications tailored to manufacturing engineering processes. This resource is designed to help second-year manufacturing engineering students build foundational programming skills while connecting them to real-world contexts, such as injection molding, vacuum infusion of composites, and tensile testing.

By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:
* Define and use variables to represent manufacturing process parameters.
* Utilize control structures like loops and conditionals to analyze and simulate manufacturing scenarios.
* Create and use functions to solve practical problems, such as calculating cooling rates.
* Perform data analysis and visualization to draw meaningful insights.

The goal is to provide you with the skills to analyze manufacturing data, develop testing plans, and understand the relationships between process parameters and product properties. Letâ€™s get started!
